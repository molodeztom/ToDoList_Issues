At the **very least** a bug report must provide:

- The **operating system** you are running ToDoList on (eg. Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, Linux)
- The **exact version of ToDoList** you are running (eg. 6.9.6, 7.0.RC2)
- A **precise set of steps** for reproducing the issue 
- **Screenshot(s)** if the issue is in the UI (including error messages)

Bug reports not containing this information will tend to be de-prioritised in favour of those that do.
