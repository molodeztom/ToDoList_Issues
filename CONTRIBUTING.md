At the **very least** a bug report must provide:

- A label for the **operating system** you are running ToDoList on (eg. Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1, Linux)
- A label for the **exact version of ToDoList** you are running (eg. 6.9.6, 7.0.RC5, 7.0.0)
- A **precise set of steps** for reproducing the issue 
- **Screenshot(s)** if the issue is in the UI (including error messages)

Bug reports not containing this information will tend to be de-prioritised in favour of those that do.

If you are reporting a bug in new functionality, or a bug that has been present for several releases, please label it as a **Bug**. If existing functionality has broken, and is different from the immediately prior release, please Also flag it with label **Regression**, and indicate the release where the functionality worked. All regressions are bugs (so we need both labels), but not all bugs are regressions (these will only have the Bug label).

*We previously said "An issue should not be flagged as both Bug and Regression" but this is no longer the case.*
