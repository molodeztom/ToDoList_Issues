At the very least a bug report needs to provide:

- The operating system you are running ToDoList on
- The exact version of ToDoList you are running
- A precise set of steps for reproducing the issue
- Screenshot(s) if the issue is in the UI

Bug reports not containing this information will tend to be de-prioritised in favour of those that do.
